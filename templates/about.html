  <h2>About this Website</h2>
  <div class=box>
    <h3>What's this?</h3>
    <p>
      This website aggregates the official Brink forums and the known twitter
      accounts of developers for news from the sources.  It updates in 15
      minute intervals and aggregates most developer accounts.  In case you
      think I am missing one, <a href=mailto:armin.ronacher@active-4.com>shoot
      me a line</a> and I will add him or her.
    <h3 id=contact>Who is behind this?</h3>
    <p>
      <a href=http://immersedcode.org/>Armin Ronacher</a>.  You can contact me
      <a href=mailto:armin.ronacher@active-4.com>via mail</a> or
      <a href=http://twitter.com/mitsuhiko>Twitter</a>.
    <h3>Why does this website exist?</h3>
    <p>
      Following the twitter accounts of all developers is not the problem, but
      also finding what they write into the forums is too much work.  However every
      once in a while there is some interesting information in the forums which
      is why I decided to automatically collect that information.
    <h3>There is too much information</h3>
    <p>
      Indeed.  If you have some ideas how I could filter out useless tweets and
      stuff, let me know.
    <h3 id=missing-dev>I am missing on this list / X is missing on this list</h3>
    <p>
      This website aggregates developers working on Brink.  If you are missing
      or someone you know is missing, please let me know and provide this
      information: real name, twitter account, forums account, optionally a
      short description.  If that developer does not have a twitter or forum
      account, one is enough obviously.
    <h3>Where is the Code?</h3>
    <p>
      Good that you're asking.  If you want to have a look at it, you can find the
      code on github: <a href=http://github.com/mitsuhiko/brink-aggregator>mitsuhiko/brink-aggregator</a>.
    <h3>Can I get that data?</h3>
    <p>
      Send an HTTP request with <code>Accept: application/json</code> to any of the
      URLs returning tweets or forum posts and you get JSON back.  That you can parse
      and use for your own purposes.  This website updates every ~30 minutes, so don't
      bother requesting more.  I don't have unlimited traffic on this server so please
      be kind and cache on your side.
    <h3>Why sign in with Steam?</h3>
    <p>
      If you are logged in you can favorite items.  This has the advantage that if
      enough users do that I can filter out more interesting items.  You will also be
      able to find again items you found interesting in the past.  If you sign
      in with steam on this website no account information is transmitted to
      this website besides a unique number that keeps you apart from others and
      your current username (as well as real name if you have specified it).
    <p>
      If you don't have a steam account yet, you can create one for free
      <a href=https://store.steampowered.com/join/>on the steam website</a> and
      use that to log into this website.
